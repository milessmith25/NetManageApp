# NetManageApp

A personal project to monitor home network devices and send status alerts.

## Overview
NetManageApp is a hobby project I’m building to track device health (like routers) and notify users about updates or issues. It’s a self-driven experiment to learn API integrations and network management—currently testing SMS notifications with Twilio.

## Status
- Early development—focusing on messaging features.
- Developer: Miles Smith
